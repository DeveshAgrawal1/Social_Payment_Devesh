I chose JAVA over C++ to implement this project.

Personally, I like C++ for programming purposes like online competitions, partly also because it is the first programming language I learned.

But, as far as bigger projects are concerned like this one, I use JAVA because:

# It has a built in garbage collection system which I feel is a very big advantage as we don't have to worry about deleting an array or such things.
# Multi Threading, though I didn't use it in this project, but it is a very useful concept to be used in a project.
# It is very secure because it uses a JVM.
# Also, if this program had to be made in GUI, it would be tons easier to create it in JAVA than C++.
